    "quiz": "Here are 5 hard-level multiple-choice questions about deadlock, based on the provided passage:\n\n**Q1.** Which of the following statements concerning deadlock handling strategies in distributed systems is most accurate, based on the text?\nA) Deadlock prevention, achieved by acquiring all resources simultaneously, is a highly efficient and practical approach in distributed systems due to minimal inter-site communication.\nB) Deadlock avoidance, while theoretically sound, is often impractical in distributed systems primarily due to the difficulty of ensuring a safe global state with the inherent uncertainty and delays in inter-site communication.\nC) Deadlock detection is generally avoided because of the complexity of maintaining a Wait-For-Graph across distributed sites.\nD) A hybrid approach combining deadlock prevention and avoidance is the most favoured since it mitigates the drawbacks of individual approaches.\nAnswer: B\n\n**Q2.** According to the text, what is the primary implication of satisfying the \"Progress\" condition in a deadlock detection algorithm?\nA) The algorithm should never falsely detect deadlocks that do not exist, ensuring system stability.\nB) The algorithm must eventually detect all existing deadlocks within a finite timeframe, even if it requires waiting for additional events beyond the initial wait-for dependencies.\nC) After all wait-for dependencies for a deadlock have formed, the algorithm should detect the deadlock without requiring further events or delays.\nD) All sites must have accurate knowledge of the current system state to detect any deadlock.\nAnswer: C\n\n**Q3.** Given the descriptions of deadlock models, which statement accurately differentiates the AND model from the single-resource model?\nA) In the AND model, a process can request only one resource, making it a specialized case of the single-resource model.\nB) The AND model is more general than the single-resource model because it allows a process to have multiple outstanding resource requests that must all be satisfied simultaneously.\nC) The single-resource model allows for cycles in the WFG to always indicate a deadlock, while the AND model requires additional conditions to confirm a deadlock.\nD) There are no differences between single-resource and AND models, both allow a process to have only one outstanding resource request for only one unit of resource.\nAnswer: B\n\n**Q4.** According to the text, which statement accurately describes the Mitchell and Merritt\u2019s Algorithm for the Single-Resource Model?\nA) It falls under the diffusion computation approach, diffusing deadlock detection across the WFG.\nB) It uses global state detection, taking system snapshots and examining them for deadlock conditions.\nC) It is an edge-chasing algorithm where probe messages are sent in the opposite direction of WFG edges, with deadlock detection occurring when a probe returns to its initiator.\nD) It relies on exchanging local WFGs between sites to construct a global WFG and identify cycles, therefore it is a path-pushing algorithm.\nAnswer: C\n\n**Q5.** In the Kshemkalyani-Singhal algorithm for the P-out-of-Q model, what is the function of the \"weight\" variable (wi) and the SHORT messages in termination detection?\nA) The weight variable is used to prioritize processes in deadlock resolution, while SHORT messages indicate that a process has been rolled back.\nB) The weight variable tracks the number of resources held by a process, and SHORT messages are used to request additional resources.\nC) The weight variable is a local count of outstanding requests and replies, used in coordination with ECHO messages.\nD) The weight variable (wi) is used to track the progress of the algorithm, being distributed among FLOOD and ECHO messages, with SHORT messages returning unused weights to the initiator to signal termination.\nAnswer: D\n"
